          Nuclides are the core functions and building blocks that are used to create this styleguide and at the same time, our SASS-based UI starter.
        p.SG-p. 
          They are not directly useable on their own. But using them we can create other nuclides, scale up to create atoms, molecules or even more complex structures.
        p.SG-p.
          We have three different types of nuclides:
        p.SG-p.
          - configuration variables (eg: ui config, colors, fonts and sizes),
        p.SG-p.
          - core patterns and functions named CSS Helper mixins(eg: flexbox mixins), 
        p.SG-p.
          - advanced functions named CSS Enhancements mixins (eg: height centering mixins, responsive breapoints mixins, etc).
